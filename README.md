### General Description
The dataset is retrieved from Machine Learning Website by Professor Eric Suess at http://www.sci.csueastbay.edu/~esuess/stat6620/#week-6. It contains 7 features (4 numerical and 3 categorical), and the target column contains medical expenses incurred by each individual.  

### Goals

1. Divide the features into two sections: numerical and categorical in order to clean and transform each appropriately. 
2. For categorical features:
    a. create a dataframe and clean missing data
    b. represent data visually in an appropriate format
    c. drop irrelevant features within reason and logic presented. 
    d. convert categorical variables to represent in a binary format.  
3. For numerical features:
    a. create a dataframe and clean missing data
    b. represent data visually in an appropriate format
    c. drop irrelevant features within reason and logic presented. 
4. Create a Linear Model, fit and predict the relevant features. 
5. Use appropriate metrics to measure effectiveness of model.
